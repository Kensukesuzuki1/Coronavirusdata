# Mental Health Indicator Data taken during the COVID 19 Pandemic.

This dataset tracks three Mental Health Indicators( 'Symptoms of Depressive Disorder', 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder') for various groups within the United States over a 7 week period from April 23, 2020, to June 16, 2020.

I was inspired to work on this project because I wanted to understand what people in America were feeling going into the new year.

## With this dataset I set out to find out:

To see the evolution of mental health indicators in 2020.
- Which subgroup has had the highest increases in any mental health indicator?
- Are certain states, like those in the Suicide Belt of America, seeing a noticeable increase in Mental Health Indicators?

## With these questions in mind, I hope that an analysis of this dataset can be used to:
- Direct investments into mental health towards the most affected groups/regions.
- Direct research into the root causes of worsening mental health outcomes.
- Use the research data to improve public health outcomes.
- (With additional Data) Compare mental health indicators from last year to see if the COVID19 pandemic has significantly affected mental health.
- (With additional Data) Model the economic costs of worsening mental health outcomes going into 2021.

# Limitation
This dataset does have major limitations in that:
- This dataset does not track the intersections of the group meaning the analysis is limited to within a specific group. (State v State, Female vs Male, etc.)
- The last date data point was captured was on the week of June 11 - June 16. With a vaccine and a 2nd stimulus package that has cleared the Senate(as of 12/22/2020), this could considerably change how people's mental health status.
- This dataset does not take into consideration the root causes of these mental health statuses. Covid-19 is a prominent cause for concern but not the only reason. In the United States, 2020 has had several events that were cause for concern such as:
- The U.S. Senate Acquiting Donald Trump of Impeachment Charges.
- Continuing Trade war between the People's Republic of China and the United States.
- Increased Tensions between Iran and the United States.
- The Killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests that occurred in major American cities.
- Seeing the effects of Climate Change worldwide.
- Unemployment numbers that eclipsed the worst of the 2008 Financial Crisis.
- School Closures.
- Social Distancing and the canceling of several major events.
- An election year.
